## Overview

The goal of *Naija Restaurant* is to create a user-friendly system where customers can register, log in, and manage their own bookings. Admins handle overall reservation management. This project mirrors a full-stack development process with a focus on clarity and simplicity.

---

## Strategy

Built using the *Django framework* with *SQLite (at development) and PostgreSQL (at production), and authenticated via **Django-Allauth. The UI leverages **Bootstrap 5* for responsive and fast front-end development. The project followed Agile practices, using *user stories* managed on a [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/Irelandoracle1/projects/5), with features prioritized via a MoSCoW backlog to support incremental builds with constant validation.
